### Hi there 👋

My professional work centers on the intersections of mathematics, statistics, health equity and disparities, and data visualization. 

I'm currently working at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health with [Nancy Krieger](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nancy-krieger/) and [Jarvis Chen](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/jarvis-t-chen-scd/) to understand how complex patterns of discrimination affect people's health using hierarchical/multi-level modeling and causal inference.  We have been working on writing a series of articles about COVID-19 in the United States including the following: 

- [COVID-19: US federal accountability for entry, spread, and inequities—lessons for the future](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-020-00689-2)
- [The Evolving Roles of US Political Partisanship and Social Vulnerability in the COVID-19 Pandemic from February 2020 - February 2021](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3933453)
- [US racial and ethnic data for COVID-19 cases: still missing in action](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32220-0/fulltext)
- [Intersectional inequities in COVID-19 mortality by race/ethnicity and
education in the United States, January 1, 2020–January 31, 2021](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1266/2021/02/21_Chen_covidMortality_Race_Education_HCPDS_WorkingPaper_Vol-21_No-3_Final_footer.pdf)
- [Missing again: US racial and ethnic data for COVID-19 vaccination](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00465-7/fulltext)
